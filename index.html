<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer.</p> 
<p>It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware.</p> 
<p>It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language.</p> 
<p>Without an operating system, a computer is useless.</p>
