<h3>Virtual Memory</h3>
<p>Virtual memory is a memory management capability of an operating system (OS) -- which uses hardware and software to allow a computer to compensate for physical memory
shortages, by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage. Virtual address space is increased using active memory in RAM and inactive
memory in hard disk drives (HDDs), to form contiguous addresses that hold both the application and its data.
Virtual memory was developed at a time when physical memory -- the installed RAM -- was expensive. Computers have a finite amount of RAM, so memory can run out, especially
when multiple programs run at the same time. A system using virtual memory uses a section of the hard drive to emulate RAM. With virtual memory, a system
can load larger programs or multiple programs running at the same time, allowing each one to operate as if it has infinite memory and without having to purchase
more RAM.
While copying virtual memory into physical memory, the OS divides memory into pagefiles or swap files with a fixed number of addresses. Each page is stored on a disk
and when the page is needed, the OS copies it from the disk to main memory and translates the virtual addresses into real addresses.</p>

<p>Virtual memory also frees applications from managing shared memory and saves users from having to add memory modules when RAM space runs out.</p>
