<h3>Types of Operating System</h3>
<p>An Operating System performs all the basic tasks like managing file,process, and memory. Thus operating system acts as manager of all the resources, i.e. resource manager. Thus operating system becomes an interface between user and machine.</p>
<h5>Types of Operating Systems: Some of the widely used operating systems are as follows:</h5>

  <tr>
 <td>1. Batch Operating System:</td>
 <td>It runs on a server and provides the server the capability to control data, users, groups, security, applications and other networking functions.</td>
    <td><li>It is very difficult to guess or know the time required by any job to complete.
      Processors of the batch systems know how long the job would be when it is in
      queue</li>
  <li>Multiple users can share the batch systems</li>
  <li>The idle time for batch system is very less</li>
  <li>It is easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems</li></td>
  </tr>
<td>Time-sharing operating systems</td>
<td>Each task is given some time to execute, so that all the tasks work smoothly. Each
user gets time of CPU as they use single system. These systems are also known as
Multitasking Systems. The task can be from single user or from different users also.
The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum. After this time interval is
over OS switches over to next task.</td>
  <td><li>Each task gets an equal opportunity</li>
  <li>Less chances of duplication of software</li>
  <li>CPU idle time can be reduced</li></td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Distributed operating System</td>
    <td>These types of operating system is a recent advancement in the world of computer
technology and are being widely accepted all-over the world and, that too, with a
great pace. Various autonomous interconnected computers communicate each other
using a shared communication network. Independent systems possess their
own memory unit and CPU.</td>
    <td><li>Electronic mail increases the data exchange speed</li>
  <li>Load on host computer reduces</li>
  <li>Delay in data processing reduces</li>
    <li>Load reduction on host computer.</li>
    <li>Reduction of the data processing delays.</li></td>
