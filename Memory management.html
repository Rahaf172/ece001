<h3>Memory Management</h3>

<p>Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages
primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during
execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of
either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to
processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some
memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.</p>

<h3>Memory Addresses & Description</h3>

<h4>1. Symbolic addresses</h4>

<p>The addresses used in a source code. The variable names, constants, and instruction
labels are the basic elements of the symbolic address space.</p>

<h4>2. Relative addresses</h4>

<p>At the time of compilation, a compiler converts symbolic addresses into relative addresses.</p>

<h4>3. Physical addresses</h4>

<p>The loader generates these addresses at the time when a program is loaded into main memory.</p>
